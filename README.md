# 📘 TypeScript Insights: A Developer's Blog

Welcome to this technical blog post embedded in the `README.md` file of the repository. This post explores two powerful and commonly misunderstood concepts in TypeScript, with practical examples and explanations to help you write safer and more expressive code.

## 🧩 What Are the Differences Between Interfaces and Types in TypeScript?

In TypeScript, both `interface` and `type` can be used to describe the shape of data. While they overlap in many cases, they have different strengths and use cases.

### ✅ Interfaces

- Best for defining the **shape of objects**.
- Can be **extended** using `extends`.
- Ideal for **object-oriented programming** and when working with class-based structures.
- **Merges declarations** — multiple `interface` declarations with the same name are automatically merged (great for augmenting types).

  age: number;
}



# any – The Escape Hatch
🔹The any type disables all type checking for a variable. When you use any, you're telling TypeScript to trust you and not complain, even if your code might lead to runtime errors.

🔸 unknown – Safer Alternative to any
The unknown type is similar to any in that it can hold any value, but it doesn’t let you do anything with the value until you perform a type check. This makes it much safer than any

⚠️never – For Code That Shouldn’t Happen
The never type represents values that should never occur. It's used for situations where a function doesn't return (e.g., it always throws an error), or when you're ensuring exhaustive checks in control structures.
