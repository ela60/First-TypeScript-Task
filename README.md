# 📘 TypeScript Insights: A Developer's Blog

Welcome to this technical blog post embedded in the `README.md` file of the repository. This post explores two powerful and commonly misunderstood concepts in TypeScript, with practical examples and explanations to help you write safer and more expressive code.

## 🧩 What Are the Differences Between Interfaces and Types in TypeScript?

In TypeScript, both `interface` and `type` can be used to describe the shape of data. While they overlap in many cases, they have different strengths and use cases.

### ✅ Interfaces

- Best for defining the **shape of objects**.
- Can be **extended** using `extends`.
- Ideal for **object-oriented programming** and when working with class-based structures.
- **Merges declarations** — multiple `interface` declarations with the same name are automatically merged (great for augmenting types).

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

interface User {
  email: string;
}

# 📘 Understanding `any`, `unknown`, and `never` in TypeScript

TypeScript offers advanced types to handle different situations safely and clearly. Let's explore the differences between `any`, `unknown`, and `never`.

## 🔍 Type Comparison Table

| Type     | Description                                | Safe? | When to Use                                 |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------|
| `any`    | Opts out of type checking                  | ❌    | Prototyping or migrating from JavaScript    |
| `unknown`| Accepts any value, but must be type-checked| ✅    | Handling unknown or dynamic input           |
| `never`  | Represents values that never occur         | ✅    | Exhaustive checks or error-throwing funcs   |

## 🔹 `any` – The Escape Hatch

The `any` type disables type checking for a variable. It's like telling TypeScript: "Trust me, I know what I'm doing."

```ts
let value: any = "hello";
value = 10;
value.toUpperCase(); // No error, but could fail at runtime
